Title: Construct and Fit a State-Space Model in 'JAGS' through 'jagsUI'
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2023-11-20
Author: Matt Tyers [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Matt Tyers <matttyersstat@gmail.com>
Description: The main functionality is a wrapper function that uses user input
    to write model code in JAGS syntax to a temporary text file, and then 
    optionally run that model with a user-supplied vector of time-series data 
    and optionally corresponding time measurements.  A 'jagsUI' output object
    is then returned.  Functions are also provided for visualization of the 
    respective model components.
